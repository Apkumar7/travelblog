        Rajasthan is a state in Northwest India. It comprises the inhospitable
        Thar Desert. There are several major tourist cities in Rajasthan, in
        this blog we will cover our experience in 2 of the major tourist cities,
        Jaisulmer and Jodhpur. Our journy starts in the the city of Jaisulmer,
        which is also called the <i>Golden City</i>. Jaisulmer is home to
        desirable yellow sandstone which is mined and transported around the
        world. Most building that have been built for centuries have been built
        with this sandstone, when the sun sets the city lights up a golden
        color. Like most cities in Rajasthan, Jaisulmer's landscape is definded
        by a magnificent fort that has protected the city for centruries. The
        fort is unique because people still live in the fort to this day, even a
        King(who doesn't rule over anything). Rajasthan is also known for its
        wonderful archatectural buildings and antique doors(like the one
        photographed above). These are not ruins by any means, they are still
        functional and are still part of everyday life.

        <b>Patwaon Havali:</b><br />
        Rajasthan is home to hundreds if not thousands of Havalies which are
        like royal mansions; they involve intrecate carvings in what looks like
        wood but is actually carved yellow sandstone.

            <b>Jaisalmer Fort</b><br />
            It is one of the few "living forts" in the world. Some portion of
            the old city's polpulation still resides inside of the fort. The
            yellow sandstone helps camouflage the fort in the yellow desert. As
            you make your way through the fort, you can't help but be in awe of
            the majestic walls with their intricate stone carvings. Inside you
            will find resedences, museums, temples and bazars.

          Bada Bagh is a royal cenotaph. It is a picturesque monument that is

          evening(sunset).

          <b>Gadisar Lake</b><br />
          Gadisar Lake is an artificial lake in Jaisalmer. It was built by king
          Jaisal in 1156 AD and later rebuilt around 1367 AD. It is said that
          this lake once provided water to the entire city. You will find this
          place to be immensly crowded in the evenings however if you are an
          early bird, you will almost have the entire place to yourselves.

      <div class="food">
        <p>
          Food is an important part of any travel, so make time in your
          itinerary to sample the local delicacies. Breakfast here starts heavy
          (you're going to need this for all the walking you're about to do),
          <i>Parathas</i> lathered with ghee is a staple. Donâ€™t forget to try
          <i>Ker Sangri</i> for lunch. It is a curry using ingredients that
          grows on trees and shrubs* that are found in abundance in the desert.
          This curry goes well with <i>Bajra Roti</i>. Try eating with your
          hands like the locals do,as it adds to the taste. Most lodging places
          have a terrace restaurant, make sure you arrive early so you can get a
          table with a great view of the forts and the city! Another must-try in
          Rajasthan is <i>Kachori*</i>, which is a deep-fried crispy bread snack
          with various savory fillings, followed by <i>lassi</i>, which is a
          buttermilk drink that is a quencher in the desert heat. Make sure to
          stop by and try some street food, the locals can help you spot the
          good ones. We tried Shahi Samosa which was by the clock tower in the
          blue city(Jodhpur). The food justified the standing room only crowd in
          the store. Chai*(NOT Chai Tea, as that is redundant) is the
          quintessential drink if you are in Northern India, you will find many
          local roadside Chai shops that serve you the Chai in biodegradable
          terracotta cups which are great for the environment.

      <h2 class="heading2">Transportation</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="transportation">
      No matter where you land in India, you can fly to Jodhpur, Rajasthan. I
      would recomend flying IndiGo which is one of the leading domestic and
      internation airlines that India offers. When you get to Jodhpur you can
      hire a traveler minivan for the entirety of your trip. The driver is also
      your guide and it helps because they are local to the area. All the major
      cities in Rajasthan are 5 hours away from Jodhpur. If you can, try and
      stay awake for the ride because you can see some amazing scenery along the
      way. The scenery ranges from wild camels munching on trees to women and
      men dressed in local attire, traffic-navigating cows crossing the road.
      With 2-wheelers, bikes, lorries (trucks), and 4-wheelers all sharing the
      same road, the lanes become fluid and the cars move around in zig-zags so
      it's best to sit back and let the experts do the driving, they make it
      quite comfortable.Inside the city,you can also wave down an
      auto-rickshaw(auto) which is a very common 3-wheeled vehicle. Riding in
      the back of one of these vehicles is fun! The experience is one of the
      best I have had! It does not matter how you get around just enjoy the
      travel as it will take a long time and you get to see a lot of senery that
      you would not get to see if you were flying to different places.

    <h2 class="heading">Desert Camping/Glamping</h2>
    <p class="desertcamp">
      Desert camping (or more like glamping), is an experience you will never
      forget. From the jeep rides to the freezing cold showers, sand everywhere,
      camel rides ,the memories will stay with you forever. There are many
      companies that offer desert glamping where you can spend the night in
      tents, and wake up to camels and peacocks. There is usually a dinner
      program with authentic Rajasthani food and dance performances for all the
      guests. This can be an adventure packed day with dune bashing, camel back
      riding, parasailing and Jeep safaris. The Thar desert is considered one of
      the best spots for stargazing. Try to plan your trip around no moon day so
      you can get a glimpse of the Milky Way! The concept of desert glamping
      caters to those who seek adventure but prefer not to compromise on
      comfort. It attracts a diverse range of travelers, from nature enthusiasts
      looking to immerse themselves in the unique desert ecosystem to luxury
      seekers who want a taste of the high life against a backdrop of untouched
      wilderness.
