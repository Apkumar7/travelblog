          Rajasthan is a state in Northwest India. It comprises the inhospitable
          Thar Desert. There are several major tourist cities in Rajasthan. In
          this blog, I will cover two of the major tourist cities, Jaisalmer and
          Jodhpur. Our journey starts in the the city of Jaisalmer, which is
          also called the
          <i>Golden City</i>. Jaisalmer is home to desirable yellow sandstone
          which is mined and exported around the world. Most buildings in the
          city are built with this sandstone. When the sun sets, the city lights
          up a golden color. Like most cities in Rajasthan, Jaisalmer's
          landscape is defined by a magnificent fort that has protected the city
          for centuries. The fort is unique because people still live in the
          fort to this day, even the royal family. Rajasthan is also known for
          its wonderful architectural buildings and antique doors(like the one
          photographed above). These are not ruins by any means, they are still
          functional and are part of everyday life.

          Jaisalmer Fort is one of the few "living forts" in the world. Some
          portion of the old city's population still resides inside of the fort.
          The yellow sandstone helps camouflage the fort in the yellow desert.
          As you make your way through the fort, you can't help but be in awe of
          the majestic walls with some intricate stone carvings. Inside, you
          will find residences, museums, temples and bazaars.

          Jaisal in 1156 AD and later rebuilt around 1367 AD. It is said that
          this lake once provided water to the entire city. You will find the
          lake to be immensly crowded in the evenings however if you are an
          early bird, you will almost have the entire place to yourself.

          You might not see this listed on most travel blogs, but it is a must
          see in my opinion. It is very close to the desert camping resorts, so
          you might pass right by it if you are not looking for it.
          Historically, girl's education has been a difficult subject in India
          and a lot is being done to improve access to education. Rajkumari
          Ratnavathi Girls school is a school in rural Thar Desert of Jaisalmer.
          Its unique architecture allows it to withstand the extreme heat of the
          desert. The oval-shaped structure is built with golden sandstone and
          it is effectively angled to allow wind to circulate cool air. The
          building is designed in such a way that use of air conditioning is not
          required!

        It features palaces, forts and temples. It is known as the
        <i><b>Blue City</b></i

        forget to stop by local tea shops on the way, Kesar (saffron) Chai is a
        specialty here. Served in terracotta cups, it is best enjoyed sitting on
        the cots that are laid out in the front of such tea shops.

          Mehrangarh Fort stands a hundred feet on a perpendicular cliff,
          defining the majestic skyline of Jodhpur. It is one of the best
          preserved forts in India. Rudyard Kipling called it "the work of
          giants" due to its colossal proportions. It has been known that
          elephants were once used to break into the fort during wars. There is
          an elevator, but if possible, it is recommended to walk up the fort to
          experience this architectural wonder. Inside the fort, you will also
          see palaces and museums. These feature collections of Arms, Armours,
          textiles, furniture, and the famous miniature paintings of Rajasthan.
          Once you reach the top of the fort, you will be rewarded with a
          beautiful view of the Blue City below.

          Jodhpur is known as the blue city as buildings in the oldest district
          are painted in shades of blue. Although many explanations exist for
          the origins of the custom of painting homes blue, it is a sight to
          behold and now defines the city of Jodhpur as a contrast to the desert
          shades of the arid Thar Desert. You can catch a glimpse of the Blue
          City from the fort and other viewpoints across the city, walking
          through the narrow lanes lined with homes painted in shades of blue
          embellished with murals depicting traditional rural life. There are
          several spots along the way that provide a great backdrop for
          photography, remember to wear shades of blue! As the narrow lanes can
          be winding, it is best to go with a guide so you don't lose your way

          Food is an important part of any travel, so make time in your
          itinerary to sample the local delicacies. <br />Breakfast here starts
          heavy (you're going to need this for all the walking you're about to
          do), <i>Parathas</i> lathered with ghee is a staple. Don’t forget to
          try <i>Ker Sangri</i> for lunch. It is a curry using ingredients that
          grows on trees and shrubs* that are found in abundance in the desert.
          This curry goes well with <i>Bajra Roti</i>. Try eating with your
          hands like the locals do,as it adds to the taste.<br />
          Most lodging places have a terrace restaurant, make sure you arrive
          early so you can get a table with a great view of the forts and the
          city!<br />
          Another must-try in Rajasthan is <i>Kachori*</i>, which is a
          deep-fried crispy bread snack with various savory fillings, followed
          by <i>lassi</i>, which is a buttermilk drink that is a quencher in the
          desert heat. Make sure to stop by and try some street food, the locals
          can help you spot the good ones. We tried Shahi Samosa which was by
          the clock tower in the blue city(Jodhpur). The food justified the
          standing room only crowd in the store.<br />
          Chai*(NOT Chai Tea, as that is redundant) is the quintessential drink
          if you are in Northern India. You will find many local roadside Chai
          shops that serve you Chai in biodegradable terracotta cups which are
          great for the environment.

          No matter where you land in India, you can fly to Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
          I would recommend flying IndiGo which is one of the leading domestic
          and international airlines in India.<br />
          When you get to Jodhpur you can hire a traveler minivan for the
          entirety of your trip. The driver is also your guide and it helps
          because they are local to the area. All the major cities in Rajasthan
          are 5 hours away from Jodhpur. If you can, try and stay awake for the
          ride because you can see some amazing scenery along the way. <br />The
          scenery ranges from wild camels munching on trees to women and men
          dressed in local attire to traffic-navigating cows crossing the road.
          With 2-wheelers, bikes, lorries (trucks), and 4-wheelers all sharing
          the same road, the lanes become fluid and the cars move around in
          zig-zags so it's best to sit back and let the experts do the driving-
          they make it quite comfortable. Inside the city, you can also wave
          down an auto-rickshaw(auto) which is a very common 3-wheeled vehicle.
          Riding in the back of one of these vehicles is fun! The experience is
          one of the best I have had! <br />It does not matter how you get
          around, just enjoy the journey as you will get to see scenes that you
          would miss if you were flying.

      <h3><b>Desert Camping</b><br /></h3>

          Desert camping (or glamping), is an experience you will never forget.
          From the jeep rides to the freezing cold showers, sand everywhere,
          camel rides, the memories will stay with you forever.<br />
          There are many companies that offer desert glamping where you can
          spend the night in tents, and wake up to camels and peacocks. There is
          usually a dinner program with authentic Rajasthani food and dance
          performances for all the guests. <br />This can be an adventure packed
          day with dune bashing, camel back riding, parasailing and Jeep
          safaris.<br />
          The Thar desert is considered one of the best spots for stargazing.
          Try to plan your trip around no moon day so you can get a glimpse of
          the Milky Way!<br />
          The concept of desert glamping caters to those who seek adventure but
          prefer not to compromise on comfort. It attracts a diverse range of
          travelers, from nature enthusiasts looking to immerse themselves in
          the unique desert ecosystem to luxury seekers who want a taste of the
          high life against a backdrop of untouched wilderness.
