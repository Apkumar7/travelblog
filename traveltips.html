      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Research ahead for a successful trip</b><br />Start researching
          your destination months in advance. Trust me, it will make a
          difference. Apart from researching itineraries, make sure you research
          about the best time to visit, weather conditions, and the dress code
          if any.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Booking airline tickets</b><br />
          Usually, the early bird gets the worm, however, when you're booking
          airline tickets, that might not be the case. There's usually a small
          window of time when the prices are more reasonable. Use websites like
          Google Flights that track prices and alert you when the prices drop.
          Beware as not all the websites offered by Google Flights are
          legitimate. Even after you book your tickets, keep tracking the prices
          so that you can rebook if needed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Plan ahead</b><br />International travel usually requires you to
          have a passport that is vaild at least 6 months after your travel
          date. Make sure to research any visa requirements.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Don't hesitate to interact with the locals</b><br />The locals are
          usually more than happy to chat. They will also give you tips on the
          best local places to eat, stay and visit-information that you might
          not find on the internet.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Take time to understand the customs and culture</b><br />This not
          only helps you know the "dos" and "don'ts" in the country, it will
          also add another dimension to your travel experience. Use a local
          guide when possible, they will highlight important places and history
          that otherwise might not be obvious.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Pack light</b><br />Pack light for a stress-free trip, and you will
          want to save some space for souvenirs.
