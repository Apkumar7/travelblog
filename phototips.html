        <b>Take pictures everyday</b><br />Like any skill, practice makes
        perfect. With cellphone cameras evolving everyday, you don't need an SLR
        for great photos most of the time.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Always have a camera at the ready</b><br />You never know when that
        great photo opportunity will walk right past you!
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Know your gear</b><br />If you are using an SLR, make sure to check
        your settings so that you have the correct ISO for your setting that
        day. Familiarize yourself with the options on your device. If you are
        using an Iphone, learn the different options like, night shot, long
        exposure, etc.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Have patience</b><br />Any tourist attraction is bound to draw huge
        crowds. Even in a crowd, it is possible to get a perfect picture. Be
        patient and be ready to click when you see a break in the oncoming
        crowd. Some of the photos featured in this blog have been taken in
        crowded situations, but you can't tell that from the photos.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Plan your itinerary</b><br />You want to plan to visit those picture
        perfect locations near or during sunrise or sunset to get the best
        photos. Don't be fooled, even if it is already dark outside, you can
        still take beautiful sunset photos with the Iphone's night shot mode.
        Some of the Centotaph pictures in the Rajasthan blog were taken when it
        was dark outside.
